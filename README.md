# hyperskill-python-simple-credit-calculator
### My Credit Calculator project as part of the Hyperskill Jetbrains Academy Python Developer course.

**Project Number**: #3

**Difficulty:** Easy

**About:** A credit calculator program that is run via the command line using command-line arguments. The program is able to calculate credit principal, count of periods and monthly payment for annuity payment, and also has the capacity to compute the differentiated payment. The program also calculates the overpayment.

**Learning Outcomes:** Along with doing the project itself and completing numerous problems, I was learning more about functions, string formatting, conditional statements, comparisons, loops, and typecasting in Python. I learnt how to use mathematics and Python in everyday tasks, how to use modules and libraries, and I gained knowledge of errors and error handling in Python. I advanced my skills in using command line and command-line arguments to run Python programs.

**FYI:** Examples of running the program:  
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         ``` python credit_calculator.py --type=diff --principal=1000000 --periods=10 --interest=10 ```  
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         ``` python credit_calculator.py --type=annuity --principal=1000000 --periods=60 --interest=10 ```  
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         ``` python credit_calculator.py --type=annuity --payment=8722 --periods=120 --interest=5.6 ```  
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         ``` python credit_calculator.py --type=annuity --principal=500000 --payment=23000 --interest=7.8 ```
